# Extra Utilities Discord Bot
With very simple, fun, and useful commands that are very easy-tu-use and intuitive!

## Instructions
* Set edit your configurations in the `example_config.json` file and rename it to `config.json`.
* The default prefix is '!' so this guide will be written with that in mind.

## Easy-to-use Commands!
* Tons of `(optional)` arguments, and helpful defaults if no arguments are provided.
** Required arguments are given in angle brackets `<required>`, while optional arguments are in parenthesis `(optional)`.
* `<user>` doesn't have to be a mention! Can be a mention `@spartan` or all or part of the user's name `spar`. Do note that the bot will find the first user that has `spar` in their name, so using a `@mention` is preferred when multiple users have `spar` in their name, such as `jealousparkingspot`.
* Note: `<channel-name>` can either be a mention `#general` or just the channel's name in plain text `general`. This will not search for channels containing your input such as `gen` for `#general`.
* Note: `<voice-channel-name>` however, can be partial, since it is very difficult to mention a voice channel. For example, `music` can find the voice channel `â™¬ Music Channel`.
